# The Type Theory Zoo

A collection of notes on various features commonly found in type theories whose definitions I always forget.

## Planned Topics (a wishful list)
* Basic type theory (there are so many people who have already done this)
  * First-order predicate logic in judgement form
  * Types are propositions, terms are proofs, computation is proof simplification
  * Syntax and judgement forms
  * The MLTT model (formation/introduction/elimination/computation/uniqueness rules)
  * The PTS model (rules and axioms)
* Type universes (want!!)
  * The universe hierarchy
  * Cumulativity
  * Impredicativity
  * Girard's paradox
  * Proof-irrelevant universes
  * Limit universes
* Coinductive structures, M types, nu-types, corecursion
* Induction-recursion, induction-induction, higher inductive types (maybe not)
* Univalence, n-types (without going too much into HoTT)

## TODOs
* Remove introducing dependent eliminators from _Notions of Equality_
* Fix DOT graph generation
